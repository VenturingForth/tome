# Tome
## A *Frostgrave* Companion Web App
### About *Tome*
*Tome* is a web application that helps players manage their wizards and their warbands 
for Osprey Games' skirmish game [Frostgrave](https://www.ospreypublishing.com/uk/osprey-games/wargames/frostgrave/)
and designed by Joseph A. McCullough. This purely a fan based project made as a learning
experience in creating a full stack application using a .NET framework
and clean architecture design methods.
